# marvix
a major script that will be used for my own mahjong game in tabletop simulator.

All scripts are made in .lua due to the fact that TTS only supports lua as a type of script.

**Warning**
this code is primarily intended for tabletop simulator. if you use this code, you must convert the scripts like from 
```lua 
what1.getAllObjects()
```
to
```lua
what1.test()
```

The script will mainly cover buttons for scoring and to detect cards.

Checklist (current):
1. complete the meld sorter.
2. complete configuration.
3. sampling.
